My name is Bradley Gronefeld. I am 22 years old, and I am from Statesboro, GA. I went to Statesboro High School, where I played baseball at and where I was more into construction. I loved to build things at the time. One of my favorite projects I ever worked on was building two cornhole boards out of pallets. Towards the end of my senior year in high school, I started getting more into technology. My grandfather worked at IBM as a software developer, and I got interested from hearing him talk about what he does.
</p>
<p>
The first college I went to was Reinhardt University. I chose to go there to continue my love for the game of baseball. For education, I chose Cybersecurity as my major. I studied at Reinhardt University for three years, until I started having shoulder issues in baseball. Because Reinhardt was so expensive, I couldn’t afford it, so I decided to transfer schools. I wanted to stay up in north Georgia because this is where all my friends and girlfriend from Reinhardt were. As I was looking at other colleges, I noticed that Kennesaw State University has the number one online Cybersecurity major in the state. Seeing that pushed me to make the decision to go there.
</p> 
<p>
When I transferred to Kennesaw State University, I was going into my senior year. During my orientation, I learned that none of my Cybersecurity credits from Reinhardt transferred over. I had to take a few extra core classes and retake all the Cybersecurity classes, and that pushed me back 2 years with summer classes. My first year at Kennesaw State was pretty good, but different because of the sizes of classes compared to Reinhardt. While I was going to school, I was also the full-time closer for the Lumber Department at The Home Depot.
</p>
<p>
It was a little adjustment going from a small school to a bigger school, but I have enjoyed every second of it. I am currently getting ready to go into my last year at Kennesaw. I am going to be focusing on the Network Security side of my major because apart from programming, that is what I am most interested in. I also have a job lined for the future with Brasfield & Gorrie. I am currently interning there for IT support to get in to the company and learn the ins and outs of everything. I love what I am doing, and I am going to continue to love what I do!
